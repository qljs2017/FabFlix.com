I use LIKE pattern in two places:

1: I use '%AN%' pattern to search Star's Movie by input names.

Code Fragment: ...where s.first_name like '%" + first + "%' and s.last_name like '%" + last + "%';

2: I use 'ABC%' pattern to get all the movies that start with a given character.

Code Fragment: select id from movies where title like '"+ request.getParameter("tc") +"%';
